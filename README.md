# Graph Theory Templates
some sample codes about classical graph theoretical problems, includes:

- single source shortest path
- multi source shortest path
- minimum spanning tree
- maximum flow
- minimum/maximum cost flow

the involved algorithms:

- Prim
- Kruskal
- Dijkstra
- SPFA
- Floyd
- EK(Edmonds-Karp)
- Dinic(with Bit-Scaling optimization)
- SAP/ISAP(Shortest Augmenting Path)
- HLPP(Highest Lable Preflow Push)
