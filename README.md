# Graph Theory Templates
some sample codes about classical graph theoretical problems:

- minimum spanning tree
- single source shortest path
- multi source shortest path
- maximum flow
- minimum/maximum cost flow

<br>

the algorithms involved are:

- Prim
- Kruskal
- Dijkstra
- Bellman-Ford
- Floyd-Warshall
- EK(Edmonds-Karp)
- Dinic(with Bit-Scaling optimization)
- SAP/ISAP(Shortest Augmenting Path)
- HLPP(Highest Lable Preflow Push)
