# Graph Theory Templates
Some implementations of several classic graph theory algorithms, which can be used as templates.

<br>

the problems involved are:

- minimum spanning tree
- single source shortest path
- multi source shortest path
- maximum flow
- minimum/maximum cost flow

<br>

the algorithms involved are:

- Prim
- Kruskal
- Dijkstra
- Bellman-Ford
- Floyd-Warshall
- EK(Edmonds-Karp)
- Dinic(with Bit-Scaling optimization)
- SAP/ISAP(Shortest Augmenting Path)
- HLPP(Highest Lable Preflow Push)
